//What is the purpose of the < !DOCTYPE> declaration?
<!DOCTYPE> tells the browser which version of HTML you're using, so it knows how to display your webpage correctly.
It goes at the very top of your HTML file and helps make sure everything looks the same in different browsers. For modern websites, you just use:
Its main purpose is to ensure that the browser renders the page in standards mode rather than quirks mode.
When a browser loads a page, it checks the <!DOCTYPE> to determine how strictly it should follow web standards. Without it, browsers may fall back to quirks mode,

//What are tags and elements in HTML?
Tags are the building blocks of HTML. They tell the browser what kind of content you‚Äôre writing (like a paragraph, heading, image, link, etc.).
Semantic HTML elements are tags that clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and developers.
Instead of just saying ‚Äúthis is a block‚Äù (like <div>), semantic elements tell you what kind of content they hold, like:
=>A header?

//Why Use Semantic HTML?
Improves readability of your code
Helps with SEO (search engines understand your content better)
Makes websites more accessible (screen readers can navigate better)

üìö 1. < section >
    What it is: A section of related content.
    Use when: You have a logical grouping of content, like a group of FAQs or service listings.
                        
üì∞ 2. < article >
    What it is: A self-contained piece of content that can stand alone.  
    Use when: You‚Äôre writing things like blog posts, news articles, comments, or forum posts.
                        
üìé 3. < aside >
    What it is: Content that is related to the main content, but not essential.

// What is the use of the data-* attribute?
Ans=> The data-* attribute lets you store extra information directly in HTML elements, which you can then access using JavaScript.
                        
ex=> < div data-user-id="12345" data-role="admin">John Doe</div>
    => data-user-id="12345" ‚Üí stores a custom value for this element
    => data-role="admin" ‚Üí stores the role info
            
// üß† Why use it?
=> Adds custom metadata to HTML elements
=> Keeps your HTML clean and valid
=> Lets JavaScript dynamically read/write these values
            
// Accessing with JavaScript: 
=> const userDiv = document.querySelector('div');
=> console.log(userDiv.dataset.userId); // "12345"
=> console.log(userDiv.dataset.role);   // "admin"
=> Note: data-user-id becomes dataset.userId in camelCase in JS

üß† 1. localStorage
=> Persists even after the browser is closed
=> Data is stored indefinitely until cleared by the user or your code
=> Stores data as key-value pairs
=> Limit: ~5MB
=> Only accessible via JavaScript (not sent with requests)
=> You need to keep data long-term (e.g., user preferences, theme selection).
example.
    localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark");
    //console.log(localStorage.getItem("theme")); // "dark"
    Common uses::	Preferences, themes


üïí 2. sessionStorage
    => Cleared when the tab or window is closed
    => Same API as localStorage
    => Limit: ~5MB
    => Useful for temporary data (like form state) 
    => Data should only last for the duration of the tab session.
    example.
    sessionStorage.setItem("tempScore", "100");

                        => If JavaScript fails, the button is still visible ‚Äî user just can‚Äôt click.

                            Start with a full-featured experience, then ensure it still functions acceptably in older or less capable browsers.
            
                            //üß© Philosophy:
                            => Build for modern features first, then make sure it breaks nicely.
            
                            //‚úÖ Example:
                            => Use a fancy animated menu for modern browsers
                            => Provide a simple HTML menu fallback for older ones
            
                            < video controls>
                                < source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                                Your browser does not support the video tag.
                            < /video>
                            => If the video feature isn‚Äôt supported, the fallback message is shown.
                            
                            Feature || Progressive Enhancement || Graceful Degradation
                            => Build Focus || Starts basic, adds features || Starts advanced, scales down
                            => Primary Audience || Users with older browsers || Users with modern browsers
                            => Failure Handling || Enhancements are optional || Tries to prevent total failure
                            => Strategy || Bottom-up || Top-down
            
                            //HighLight
                            => Progressive enhancement builds from a solid base and adds features for capable browsers.
                            => Graceful degradation builds something advanced and ensures it still works (somewhat) when features fail.

                        =>Remove unnecessary whitespace: Extra spaces, line breaks, and indentation can add unnecessary bytes to the HTML file.
                        ‚úÖ 2. Reduce DOM Complexity
                            => Simplify the HTML structure: Avoid deeply nested elements. A simpler DOM tree reduces the complexity for the browser when rendering the page.
                            => Limit the number of DOM elements: Each element requires memory and processing time, so avoid adding unnecessary < div> or < span> elements.
                            => Avoid large and complex inline styles
                        ‚úÖ 3. Defer Non-Essential Resources
                            => Lazy load images: Use the loading="lazy" 
                        ‚úÖ 4. Use Semantic HTML
                        ‚úÖ 5. Optimize Images
                            => Use modern formats: Prefer using modern image formats like WebP for smaller file sizes compared to JPEG or PNG.
                            < picture>

                  // Flexbox:
                  => Use Flexbox when you want to arrange elements in a single axis ‚Äî one row or one column.
                  => It's great for simpler layouts, like navigation bars, cards, buttons, and aligning items inside a container.

                  // Grid:
                  => Use Grid when you need to create a grid-based layout with both rows and columns.
                  => It's ideal for complex page layouts, like designing a web page layout, image galleries, or dashboard grids.

                      // 2. Reusability
                      =>Mixins, functions, and variables promote code reuse, reducing redundancy and the potential for errors.

                      //3. Faster Development
                      =>Features like variables, inheritance, and mixins allow you to develop faster by eliminating repetitive code and simplifying complex tasks.

                      //4. Advanced Styling Features
                      =>SASS and LESS provide advanced features that aren‚Äôt available in regular CSS, such as color manipulation, nested styles, and more. This makes them ideal for large-scale applications with complex styles.

                      // 5. Better Organization
                      => Preprocessors allow for better organization by splitting your styles into smaller, manageable chunks and making it easier to import them into one file when needed.

                      // 6. Compatibility with CSS
                      => Both SASS and LESS compile down to standard CSS, so you can use any browser that supports CSS, and it integrates seamlessly with existing projects.
              
                      // When to Use SCSS over CSS?
                          => Larger Projects: SCSS is especially useful for larger projects where you need maintainable, scalable, and flexible styles.
                          => Team Collaboration: If working in a team, SCSS‚Äôs features like variables and mixins promote consistency and prevent redundant styles.                       
                          => Reusable Styles: SCSS makes it easier to create reusable, modular components (e.g., buttons, forms, grids) that can be reused throughout the project.                            
                          => Complex Layouts: SCSS helps with more complex layouts by supporting nesting, inheritance, and functions.

                  // Why is calc() Useful?

                  // 2. Responsive Design
                  => calc() can be particularly useful in responsive design, where you may want to set values dynamically based on the viewport size or other factors.
